# kuzushiji with MLX

This is supposed to be a playground to figure out how to use MLX in C++, while learning a bit about C++ along the way.
The implementation follows the initial MNIST NN implementation of the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) book.

The data in this repository is copied from [kmnist](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist).

If anybody would like to help me optimize this code, I'd be more than grateful. Until then I'll try myself.

## Installing

```bash
cmake .
make
```

## Running

```bash
bin/kuzushiji
```
